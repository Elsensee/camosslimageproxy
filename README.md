# phpBB Camo SSL Image Proxy Extension

This is the repository for the development of the phpBB Camo SSL Image Proxy Extension.

## Quick Install
You can install this on the latest release of phpBB 3.1 by following the steps below:

1. In the `ext` directory of your phpBB board, create a new directory named `phpbb` (if it does not already exist) and navigate to it
1. git clone git@github.com:phpbb-extensions/camosslimageproxy.git
1. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Manage extensions`.
1. Look for `Camo SSL Image Proxy` under the Disabled Extensions list, and click its `Enable` link.

Please note, this requires [Camo](https://github.com/atmos/camo) to have been setup previously.
